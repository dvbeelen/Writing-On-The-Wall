{"title":"The Nameless City: Part 1","text":{"0":"When I drew nigh the nameless city I knew it was accursed","1":"I was travelling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon, and afar I saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an ill-made grave","2":"Fear spoke from the age-worn stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge, this great-grandmother of the eldest pyramid; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see, and no man else had ever dared to see","3":"Remote in the desert of Araby lies the nameless city, crumbling and inarticulate, its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages","4":"It must have been thus before the first stones of Memphis were laid, and while the bricks of Babylon were yet unbaked","5":"There is no legend so old as to give it a name, or to recall that it was ever alive; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks, so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why","6":"It was of this place that Abdul Alhazred the mad poet dreamed on the night before he sang his unexplainable couplet:  â€œThat is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die"}}
